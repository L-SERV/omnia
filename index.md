  section_title: Heirloom tomato tart tatin
  section_description: 'The secret of a good tart tatin is the puff pastry. Our pastry
    team knows what to do to make it puffy, buttery and crispy at the same time. It’s
    the peak of tomato season which makes this a match made in heaven.  Ask our team
    for a glass or Riesling and we say no more..  '
