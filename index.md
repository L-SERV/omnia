  section_title: Zucchini flower
  section_description: Our menu is designed to create your own 3 course menu. Whilst
    you browse through the menu and have to make some hard decisions, we recommend
    you doing this with one or more snacks and a drink. For many years the smoked
    ocean trout cigar has been the favourite of our guests but the new addition to
    our menu, the zucchini flower served on lavosh bread with salsa verde and a parmesan
    custard is running close.  Available to order during dinner and also as a snack
    at the bar.
