    <h2>Our privacy commitment</h2>
    <div class="">
      <p>LK Hospitality Pty Ltd, trading as Omnia (‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’ and ‘Omnia’) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This policy explains how Omnia manages the personal information that we collect, use and disclose and how to contact us if you have any further queries about our management of your personal information. This policy does not cover personal information collected or held by Omnia or any of its related bodies corporate (as applicable) about its employees.</p>

<p>Omnia is bound by the Australian Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act) which regulate how we may collect, use, disclose and store personal information, and how individuals may access and correct personal information held about them. Omnia is also required to comply with the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) and the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 (Cth).</p>

<p>We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time by publishing changes to it on our website. We encourage you to check our website periodically to ensure that you are aware of our current Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-personal-information">What is personal information?</h4>

<p>Personal information is any information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable. Examples include an individual’s name, address, contact number and email address.</p>
