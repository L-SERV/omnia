      At Omnia, we take great pride in our cheese trolley, which stands as a
      centerpiece of culinary delight and exploration, handcrafted by Orio
      Randi. Together with fromagier Anthony Femia from Maker & Monger we have a
      carefully curated selection of artisanal and internationally sourced
      cheeses showcases the incredible range and depth of flavors that cheese
      has to offer. Our knowledgeable staff members are here to help to select
      your cheeses for the night which can be enjoyed at the bar as a snack or
